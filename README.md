# Abstract
We present an agent-based model for simulating the spread of an infectious disease through a population. The simulation allows for great amount of control over custom variables present in the system, such as the spatial distribution of people and their motion through space and time. We show the simulation is capable of reproducing the results of existing models in the literature such as SIR when stochastic effects of the model are ignored and the agents posses identical properties so they behave identically. However, the real usefulness of the model is in simulating complexity that is not possible to capture using conventional methods. We show our model produces a power-law probability distribution of epidemic sizes that is consistent with the distribution of infectious-disease epidemic sizes recorded at Faroe Island over a 100 year period. In an analysis similar to a parameter sweep, we show that starting with the simple case (approximating SIR), we can approach power law behavior as we add variability to the system. 


# Design of the Simulation
The simulation is written in C++. The object oriented aspect of the language is used heavily. OpenGL together with GLFW is used for visualization of the data. GLFW is a library for managing windows and interaction with the user written in C. See http://www.glfw.org for more information.  The code is maintained publicly on www.github.com/sahandha/SIR.

In view of the model described in our paper, the code design is pretty intuitive. We start out by defining a number of classes to capture the various aspects of the simulation. First we consider four categories: model, controller, view, and storage. Each class in the simulation belongs to a category. These categories follow the standard MVC (model-view-controller) design with the additional storage category which we use for storing data generated by the simulation. 


## Model

The model consists of various classes. First and foremost, we need to define the geometry of the problem. This is achieved by using the two classes **Domain** and **Place**. We then define a class, **Person**, to represent people. Each instance of this class is one person with certain properties to be discussed below. Next is the **InHostDynamics** class. This class handles the spread of the disease within an individual as described previously. Finally there is a class named **Disease**, which implements properties of the disease that is being considered for the simulation. Note that this allows for more than one disease to be active during a simulation, but for now we only consider a single disease spreading through the population. 

## Domain
This class is responsible for creating an overall context for the simulation. In the example used in this paper, the **Domain** is the geographic area wherein all the islands are located. 

We will skip listing the properties and methods as they are trivial.

## Place.h
An instance of this class is a location with a type, e.g., island. Depending on the type of location, individuals can enter and exit this location. The class is always aware of its occupants at any given time.
